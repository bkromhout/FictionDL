# FictionDL
#### A fanfiction downloader which strives to be simple, yet flexible.

## Usage
**You need Java 8 installed to run FictionDL.**

Basic usage of FictionDL is simple; you create a plaintext file with links to stories from [Supported Sites](../../wiki/Supported-Sites), one per line, and tell FictionDL where that file is. It will download those stories and save them as ePub files.

It can be run as a CLI app by running `java -jar FictionDL-{version}.jar`, or as a GUI app by double-clicking the jar (Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you can run the CLI app with the `-g`/`--gui` option).  
For help with the CLI app, run it with the `-?`/`--help` command.

### See the [wiki](../../wiki/) for more details.

If you're here to see my code and not so much to actually *use* FictionDL (especially if you're from a company looking to potentially hire me üëç), I would definitely recommend reading the [History and Motivation](../../wiki/History-and-Motivation) page.
