So, here are the things we want:

Easy Stuff
----------
-Get more story details for the title page.
-Ability to set save folder


Moderate Stuff
--------------
-Mark the input file for each story downloaded.


(Possibly) Hard Stuff
---------------------
-Convert files into ePUBs ourselves!! See http://www.siegmann.nl/epublib for a library perhaps??
    -Or, if it isn't that difficult, just do it ourselves... I mean, how complicated could it be??
