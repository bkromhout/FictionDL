✓So, here are the things we want:

Easy Stuff
----------
-Get more story details for the title page.
    -(For FH and FFN) Fic Type:
    -Genre:
    ✓Summary:
    -Published on:
    -Last Updated on:
    -Complete:
    ✓Word count:
    -Characters/Pairings:
    -(For SIYE) Warnings:
-Ability to set save folder


Moderate Stuff
--------------
-Mark the input file for each story downloaded.
-Allow SIYE series URLs, proprocess to get story URLs (it wouldn't be under moderate if SIYE's HTML structure wasn't crap...)


(Possibly) Hard Stuff
---------------------
-Convert files into ePUBs ourselves!! See http://www.siegmann.nl/epublib for a library perhaps??
    -Or, if it isn't that difficult, just do it ourselves... I mean, how complicated could it be?? (famous last words...)
    -If we do this, _perhaps_ I will parse FFN stories myself without using p0ody-files...
